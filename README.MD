# SparkleTrail

Bukkit plugin which gives a sparkly trail to players with the permission node `sparkle.trail`.

This was written as a custom plugin for my server way back when, but is now publicly released under the MIT license. You may do
with it as you wish within the bounds of the license (except plagiarize it, because that's not cool).

This software utilizes the [ParticleLib](https://github.com/caseif/ParticleLib) library.
